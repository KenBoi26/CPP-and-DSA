// trees -> non-linear hierarchical data structure

// depth of x -> length of path from root to x OR number of edges from root to x

// height of x -> number of edges in longest path from x to the leaf

// binary tree -> a tree in which each node have atmost 2 children

// complete Binary Tree -> all levels except the last are completely filled and all nodes are as left as possible
